    <p>The City of Boston is committed to combating climate change through various initiatives, including energy-efficient building codes, improved public transportation, and renewable energy adoption, with a goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2018, the city's emissions from buildings and transportation increased by 4%, reaching 6.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. This rise was driven by higher electricity and natural gas use, as well as a 9% increase in vehicle miles traveled. <br> <br> Despite this increase, Boston has achieved significant emissions reductions. In 2018, emissions were 20% lower than in 2005 with renewable energy credits (RECs) and 19% lower without RECs. Local government operations reduced emissions by 37% compared to 2005 with RECs and 30% without RECs. Boston achieved its 2020 goal of cutting municipal emissions 25% below 2005 levels in 2015, five years ahead of schedule. Notably, as the city's population and job opportunities grew, emissions per resident decreased by 39%, from 15 to 9 metric tons per year. Boston's economic growth, measured by Gross City Product (GCP), increased from 106 billion dollars to 129 billion, with emissions per million dollars of GCP decreasing by 35%, from 76 to 49 metric tons per million dollars.</p>

        <p>Over the past eight years, the annual changes in undergraduate and graduate enrollment, along with the population growth in Boston, have painted an interesting picture. In terms of undergraduate enrollment, there has been a consistent but somewhat modest increase for both men and women, with men seeing a slightly higher percentage change. Graduate enrollment, on the other hand, has been more volatile, with significant fluctuations in both men and women categories. Notably, 2021 marked a remarkable surge in graduate women enrollment, with a staggering 72.77% increase. Meanwhile, the Boston population has been steadily growing at a relatively stable rate.

        <h3>Exploring Greenhouse Gas Emissions at Northeastern University (2005-2022)</h3>
        <p>Take a moment to explore this graph, which offers valuable insights into the greenhouse gas emissions at Northeastern University's Boston campus. It covers a significant timeframe, spanning from 2005 to 2022.<br>At first glance, you'll notice a gradual reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions during this period, with a few gentle fluctuations along the way. This initial observation hints at the broader environmental story we're about to uncover.<br>As we delve deeper into the data, we've separated these emissions into their fundamental components: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). This separation reveals the distinct roles played by each gas in the overall emissions, providing a more intricate and comprehensive understanding of our environmental impact.<br>
            One particularly intriguing finding is the 'spike' in methane (CH4) emissions that occurred during 2014-2015, marking a temporary peak in the release of this specific gas. This unique insight sheds light on the dynamic nature of our campus's environmental footprint.</p>
