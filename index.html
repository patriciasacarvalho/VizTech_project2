    <h2>Boston and Northeastern Population Annual Percent Change</h2>
    <p>Over the past eight years, the annual changes in undergraduate and graduate enrollment, along with the population growth in Boston, have painted an interesting picture. In terms of undergraduate enrollment, there has been a consistent but somewhat modest increase for both men and women, with men seeing a slightly higher percentage change. Graduate enrollment, on the other hand, has been more volatile, with significant fluctuations in both men and women categories. Notably, 2021 marked a remarkable surge in graduate women enrollment, with a staggering 72.77% increase. Meanwhile, the Boston population has been steadily growing at a relatively stable rate. These data points reflect the dynamic nature of education and population trends in Boston over this period, with potential implications for the city's academic institutions and social landscape.</p>

        <h3>Exploring Greenhouse Gas Emissions at Northeastern University (2005-2022)</h3>
        <p>Take a moment to explore this graph, which offers valuable insights into the greenhouse gas emissions at Northeastern University's Boston campus. It covers a significant timeframe, spanning from 2005 to 2022.<br>At first glance, you'll notice a gradual reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions during this period, with a few gentle fluctuations along the way. This initial observation hints at the broader environmental story we're about to uncover.<br>As we delve deeper into the data, we've separated these emissions into their fundamental components: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). This separation reveals the distinct roles played by each gas in the overall emissions, providing a more intricate and comprehensive understanding of our environmental impact.<br>
            One particularly intriguing finding is the 'spike' in methane (CH4) emissions that occurred during 2014-2015, marking a temporary peak in the release of this specific gas. This unique insight sheds light on the dynamic nature of our campus's environmental footprint.</p>
