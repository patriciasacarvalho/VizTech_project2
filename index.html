    <h2>Boston and Northeastern Population Annual Percent Change</h2>
    <p>Over the past eight years, the annual changes in undergraduate and graduate enrollment, along with the population growth in Boston, have painted an interesting picture. In terms of undergraduate enrollment, there has been a consistent but somewhat modest increase for both men and women, with men seeing a slightly higher percentage change. Graduate enrollment, on the other hand, has been more volatile, with significant fluctuations in both men and women categories. Notably, 2021 marked a remarkable surge in graduate women enrollment, with a staggering 72.77% increase. Meanwhile, the Boston population has been steadily growing at a relatively stable rate. These data points reflect the dynamic nature of education and population trends in Boston over this period, with potential implications for the city's academic institutions and social landscape.</p>
